# SP3CTR (v0.0.4) - Spectral Packet Capture & Threat Recognition

**SP3CTR (pronounced "specter")** is a user-friendly network packet capture and analysis tool designed with the cybersecurity hobbyist and learner in mind. It aims to demystify network traffic by providing a clear, intuitive interface and simplified data presentation, moving away from the complexity of tools like Wireshark or tcpdump for initial exploration.

This project is currently in its early stages (MVP) and focuses on providing a basic, web-based interface for real-time packet sniffing and display.

## ‚ú® Core Mission

* **Accessibility:** Make network traffic analysis understandable for beginners and hobbyists.
* **Clarity:** Present packet information in plain language with a clean UI.
* **Learning Tool:** Serve as a practical application for understanding networking concepts and Python/JavaScript development.

## üöÄ Current Features (MVP - v0.0.4)

* **Web-Based UI:** A clean, dark-themed interface accessible via a web browser.
* **Network Interface Detection:** Lists available network interfaces for capture (via Python backend).
* **Real-time Packet Capture:** Start and stop packet sniffing on a selected interface.
* **Live Packet Display:** Captured packets are streamed in real-time to the web UI, showing:
    * Timestamp
    * Source & Destination IP Addresses (or MAC addresses for L2)
    * Source & Destination Ports (for TCP/UDP)
    * Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, etc.)
    * Packet Length
    * Basic Info/Summary of the packet content.
* **WebSocket Communication:** Utilizes WebSockets for efficient, real-time data transfer between the Python backend (Scapy) and the HTML/JavaScript frontend.
* **Basic Protocol Color-Coding:** Simple visual cues for different protocols in the packet list.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3
    * Scapy: For packet capture and manipulation.
    * Websockets: For real-time communication with the frontend.
    * Asyncio: For asynchronous operations in the WebSocket server.
    * Threading: To run Scapy sniffing without blocking the server.
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
    * Vanilla JS for WebSocket client logic and DOM manipulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get SP3CTR up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+:** Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
* **pip:** Python package installer.
* **Web Browser:** A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
* **Packet Capture Library (Npcap/libpcap):**
    * **Windows:** **Npcap** is required. Download and install it from the [Npcap website](https://npcap.com/#download). It's recommended to install it with "WinPcap API-compatible Mode" if you use other tools that might rely on WinPcap.
    * **Linux:** **libpcap** is usually required. Install it using your distribution's package manager:
        * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev python3-dev`
        * Fedora: `sudo dnf install libpcap-devel python3-devel`
        * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libpcap python`
    * **macOS:** libpcap is typically pre-installed with Xcode Command Line Tools. If not, installing Xcode Command Line Tools should provide it: `xcode-select --install`

### Running SP3CTR

1.  **Start the Python Backend (WebSocket Server):**
    Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, activate your virtual environment (if you created one), and run the Python backend script.
    **Important:** Packet sniffing requires administrator/root privileges.
    * **Windows:** Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) **as Administrator**.
        ```bash
        python Sp3ctrCore.py
        ```
    * **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        sudo python3 Sp3ctrCore.py
        ```
    You should see output similar to:
    ```
    --- SP3CTR [version] - WebSocket Server Ready ---
    Listening on ws://localhost:8765
    ```

2.  **Serve and Open the HTML Frontend:**
    The HTML frontend needs to be served via an HTTP server for WebSocket connections to work correctly from the browser.
    * Open a **new terminal window/tab**.
    * Navigate to the directory where your `sp3ctr_frontend.html` (or your HTML file name) is located.
    * Start Python's built-in HTTP server:
        ```bash
        # If you use python3 primarily:
        python3 -m http.server 8000
        # Or if you use python primarily:
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        (You can use a different port if 8000 is busy, just not 8765).
    * Open your web browser and navigate to:
        `http://localhost:8000/sp3ctrUI.html`
      

3.  **Using SP3CTR:**
    * The web page should connect to the WebSocket server.
    * The "Network Interface" dropdown should populate.
    * Select an interface and click "Start Capture".
    * Packets should start appearing in the table.
    * Click "Stop Capture" to halt sniffing.

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting

* **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scapy'` (or `websockets`):**
    * Ensure you have activated your virtual environment (if used) before running `pip install`.
    * Make sure you are running the Python script using the same Python interpreter/environment where the packages were installed. Check your IDE's interpreter settings (e.g., in PyCharm or VS Code).
    * Try reinstalling the package: `pip uninstall scapy websockets && pip install scapy websockets`

* **Python Backend: `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` or `Socket error: [Errno 13] Permission denied` (or similar):**
    * This means Scapy doesn't have the necessary permissions to sniff packets.
    * **Solution:** Run the Python backend script with administrator/root privileges (e.g., `sudo python3 Sp3ctrCore.py` on Linux/macOS, or "Run as administrator" for your terminal on Windows).

* **Python Backend: Errors related to `libpcap` or `Npcap` not found/not working:**
    * **Scapy relies on a packet capture library like Npcap (Windows) or libpcap (Linux/macOS).**
    * **Windows:**
        * Ensure **Npcap** is installed correctly. Download from [Npcap website](https://npcap.com/#download).
        * During Npcap installation, ensure "WinPcap API-compatible Mode" is checked if you have older tools that might need it, though Scapy generally works well with Npcap's native mode.
        * You might need to restart your system after installing/reinstalling Npcap.
    * **Linux:**
        * Ensure `libpcap-dev` (or equivalent like `libpcap-devel`) is installed. For example: `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev` or `sudo dnf install libpcap-devel`.
        * Sometimes, the issue can be with user permissions to access network devices even with sudo. This is less common for simple Scapy sniffing but can occur in complex setups.
    * **macOS:**
        * libpcap should be included with Xcode Command Line Tools. If you encounter issues, try reinstalling them: `xcode-select --install`.
        * Ensure your user has permissions. Running with `sudo` is generally required.

* **HTML Frontend: "Status: Connecting to WebSocket..." or "Status: Connection Error" and no interfaces load:**
    * **Verify the Python WebSocket server is running** and you see the "Listening on ws://localhost:8765" message in its terminal.
    * **Ensure you are serving the HTML file via an HTTP server** (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`) and accessing it via `http://localhost:8000/your_file.html`, NOT via `file:///...`. Browsers restrict WebSocket connections from `file:///` origins.
    * **Check the browser's Developer Console (F12)** for WebSocket connection errors or JavaScript errors.
    * **Firewall:** Ensure your local firewall isn't blocking connections on port 8765 or 8000 for `localhost`. This is less common for localhost connections but possible.

* **No Interfaces Listed in Dropdown (but server seems to be running):**
    * Check the Python backend terminal for any errors during interface discovery.
    * Ensure Npcap/libpcap is functioning correctly, as Scapy relies on it to list interfaces.

## üìú Short-Term Enhancements Roadmap

* More detailed packet dissection and display.
* Client-side filtering of displayed packets.
* Basic threat intelligence integration (e.g., flagging known malicious IPs).
* Saving and loading packet captures (PCAP format).
* Visualizations of network traffic ("spectral" display).
* Integration with SH4DOW and F0RT components.
