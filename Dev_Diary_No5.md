# 🧃 Dev Diary #5: Blurs, Buttons, and Bad Decisions That Worked Anyway
 
*"The UI didn’t break. That’s the update."*

📆 **Date:** June 17, 2025


💥 Build Status: Working. Possibly out of fear.


🧠 Mood: Calm. Which is worrying.

Look, I don’t know how this happened either. I opened the dev branch, slapped some backdrop filters where they didn’t belong, refactored the layout like I was owed something by the DOM, and it… worked. Not theoretically. Not in that “works on my machine” kind of way. I mean it actually held up. Even the edge cases passed without throwing a tantrum. Which frankly feels suspicious.

This was supposed to be the start of a long, drawn-out style overhaul that slowly collapsed under its own weight. Instead, it’s the cleanest visual pass I’ve ever pushed, and I have no explanation other than the CSS gods were bored and decided to let me cook.

## 🧊 Focus Mode: Look at Me, Not That

New “Focus” button added to the Packet Detail panel. When you hit it, the background blurs like it’s trying to forget the packets behind it, and the detail view gets all the attention.  
It’s purely cosmetic. Which is to say: essential.  

This isn’t a modal. It’s not some lifecycle-dependent overengineered React state puppet. It’s a single toggle that says: *look at this packet or go away*. The rest of the UI respectfully shuts up.

## 🎨 Project: Modern Slate

The old color scheme looked like a spreadsheet that had just learned shame.  
Now it doesn’t.

- **New palette**: deep slate blues with cyan accents, which is just the long way of saying “it doesn’t burn your retinas anymore.”
- **Typography overhaul**: implemented `Inter`, because it looks like I know what I'm doing. Font weights are now a deliberate decision instead of a war crime.
- **Visual hierarchy**: things now imply importance through spacing and contrast, not just their position in the DOM lottery.

## 🌈 Gradient Selection: UI Theater

Packet selection now glows. A little animated gradient swishes across the row like a screensaver from 2009 if it was tasteful.  
It doesn’t serve a purpose, but neither do seat warmers — and you still notice when they’re missing.

This is what I call “emotional UX”: makes you feel like you clicked *right*.

## 🧼 Button Cleanup Crew

- Buttons now hover like they belong in the same app.
- They match the new color theme, get a soft ring on hover, and no longer look like depressed `<div>`s.
- Accessibility improved slightly, or at least faked well enough for a first pass.

Dropdowns, tables, and miscellaneous UI gremlins were also rounded up and re-styled. If it looked wrong before, it now looks… like it was meant to be wrong, but on purpose.

## 🛠️ Dev Notes: CSS Witchcraft

- Focus mode is pure CSS. Zero JS. I’m suspicious too.
- `backdrop-filter` works as advertised, and so far hasn't caught fire in Chromium.
- Nested layout in the Packet Detail panel was flattened and simplified. You can actually read it now without feeling like you’re being punished.
- No new bugs. At least, none that screamed. The quiet ones I’ll find later.

## 🏗 F0RT Looming in the Background

This whole pass was less about SP3CTR’s final form and more about proving I can make something *look* intentional without needing 800 lines of state logic.  
That said, F0RT is happening — and it will require React, because no amount of clever class toggling will save me from the monstrosity that unified packet + traffic visualization is going to become.

This build proved that the UI ideas aren’t vapor. They render. They hold. They make the app *feel* like a tool, not just a bundle of excuses that sniffs packets.

## 🧃 Closing Thoughts

This update didn’t fight me. That’s the weird part. It went in. It held. The edges didn’t curl.  
There’s a first time for everything, I guess.

We’re past the “minimum viable tool” phase. SP3CTR now looks like something you *might* trust — even if it still logs like it’s being held hostage.

This was the last major visual pass before we cross into deeper waters. The next work is architectural. Integration. Unification. Possibly regret.

Until then: the UI is shiny, the buttons behave, and the blur works.  
That’s more than I expected.
