# 🗺️ SP3CTR Development Roadmap

Welcome to the SP3CTR (pronounced "specter") development roadmap! This document outlines our journey from the current Minimum Viable Product (MVP) towards a feature-rich 1.0 release, embodying our philosophy of clarity, education, and accessibility in network analysis.

Our goal is to build SP3CTR into an indispensable tool for cybersecurity hobbyists, students, and anyone curious about the digital conversations happening on their network.

##  🏝️ Current Status: Incremental MVP (v0.2.5 - "Ruxton")

### ✅ Core Functionality

- 🖥️ Web-based UI for interaction  ✅
- 📡 Network interface selection  ✅
- ⏯️ Start/Stop real-time packet capture  ✅
- 📄 Basic live display of packet essentials (Time, IPs, Proto, Length, Info)  ✅
- 🔗 WebSocket communication between Python backend (Scapy) and HTML/JS frontend  ✅

### 🎨 Basic UI

- 🌑 Dark theme with Tailwind CSS  
- 🌈 Simple protocol color-coding  

---

## 🚀 Path to SP3CTR 1.0

Our development will proceed in phases, incrementally adding features and refining the user experience.

### Phase 1: Enhancing Core Functionality & User Experience (Est. v0.2 – v0.5)

Focused on making the current tool more robust, user-friendly, and capable for basic analysis.

#### 💾 Save & Load Captures ✅ - 100 % Complete 

- Implement functionality to save captured packets to PCAP files  ✅
- Allow loading and analyzing existing PCAP files within SP3CTR's interface  ✅

#### 📚 Enhanced Packet Detail View - 50% Complete

- Provide a dedicated panel to show more detailed, human-readable information about a selected packet  ✅
- Include tooltips ❓ to explain common networking terms and abbreviations directly in the UI  - In Production

#### 🎨 UI Polish & Refinements

- Introduce more intuitive icons for protocols and actions  
- Refine the layout for better readability and information hierarchy ✅
- Glassmorphism UI - In Production

#### 🔍 Advanced Basic Filtering - 50 % Complete

- Expand pre-defined filters (e.g., "Show only HTTP/S traffic", "Show only DNS traffic")  
- Implement a simple text input field for filtering by IP address, port number, or protocol name  ✅

---

### Phase 2: Introducing Basic Threat Recognition & "Spectral" Visuals (Est. v0.6 – v0.7)

This phase brings SP3CTR's unique value: visual context and meaningful alerts.

#### 🚨 Basic Threat Intelligence Integration

- Flag connections to/from known malicious IP addresses or domains using a curated, updatable local list  
- Clear visual indicators for such flagged packets/connections  

#### 🔓 Insecure Protocol Detection

- Identify and highlight the use of insecure protocols (Telnet, FTP, cleartext HTTP auth, etc.)  

#### 📡 Basic Port Scan Detection

- Implement simple heuristics to detect and alert on port scanning patterns  

#### 📊 Initial "Spectral" Display

- Real-time chart (e.g., pie/bar) showing protocol distribution (TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)  

#### 💡 "Why it Matters" Explanations

- For common packet types or alerts, include plain-language explanations of what they are and why they matter  

---

### Phase 3: Advanced UX & Deeper Analytical Insights (Est. v0.8 – v0.9)

Designed to help users develop intuitive, story-based understandings of their traffic.

#### 🌊 Simplified Traffic Flow Visualization (Alpha)

- Show "Your Computer" talking to remote IPs via basic visual graph  
- Use lines/weights to indicate traffic type or volume  

#### 🗂️ Application-Level Categorization (Heuristic)

- Attempt heuristic grouping of traffic into categories: "Web Browsing", "DNS Lookup", "Online Gaming", etc.  

#### 📜 Basic "Storytelling" for Packet Sequences

- DNS query → TCP handshake → HTTP GET summarized as readable micro-narratives  

#### ⚙️ More Sophisticated Anomaly Flags (Simple)

- Flag odd behaviors: large DNS payloads, non-standard ports, etc.  
- Clearly mark as heuristic—not authoritative

## 🌟 SP3CTR 1.0: The Vision Realized

Upon reaching 1.0, SP3CTR aims to be a tool that:

- ✅ **Is Genuinely Easy to Use**: Hobbyists, students, and IT generalists can use it without steep learning curves  
- 📊 **Provides Clear, Visually Enhanced Data**: Offers intuitive visuals beyond just text rows  
- 💡 **Offers Basic Threat Identification**: Helps users detect and understand suspicious activity  
- 📚 **Serves as an Excellent Educational Tool**: Teaches protocol literacy and basic security concepts  
- 🛠️ **Is a Reliable & Useful Companion**: Performs effective packet capture, display, and analysis  

---

## 🔮 Beyond 1.0 (Future Ideas)

- Deeper integration with upcoming tools 
- More advanced "spectral" analysis and visual techniques  
- Customizable dashboards  
- Plugin architecture for community-driven extensions  
- Enhanced threat intelligence capabilities  

---

This roadmap is a living document and may evolve as the project progresses and we gather feedback. Our commitment is to build SP3CTR into a valuable tool for the cybersecurity community.  

**"Together, Strong."**
