# 🗺️ SP3CTR Development Roadmap

Welcome to the SP3CTR (pronounced "specter") development roadmap! This document outlines our journey from the current Minimum Viable Product (MVP) towards a feature-rich 1.0 release, embodying our philosophy of clarity, education, and accessibility in network analysis.

Our goal is to build SP3CTR into an indispensable tool for cybersecurity hobbyists, students, and anyone curious about the digital conversations happening on their network.

##  🏔️Phase 3: Enhanced Context & UX (Complete)

  🏷️ Heuristic Tagging: Automatic categorization of traffic (e.g., "Web Browsing", "Gaming").

  📖 Conversation Storytelling: Translates packet sequences into readable micro-narratives.

  🎨 ✨ "Sp3ctr-Aero" UI Enhancements:

  🌑 Modern Dark Theme: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive interface.

  🌈 Gorgeous Gradients & Animations: Creates a dynamic and polished user experience.

  🎴 Custom Theming: Cohesive, custom-styled tooltips and notifications.

  🎭 Focus Mode: An immersive view for deep packet inspection.
  
  ↔️ Traffic Flow Visualizer: A simple visual representation of the selected packet's journey.

## 🚀 Path to SP3CTR 1.0

Our development will proceed in phases, incrementally adding features and refining the user experience.

### Phase 1: Enhancing Core Functionality & User Experience - 100 % Complete* (Est. v0.2 – v0.5.x) ✅

Focused on making the current tool more robust, user-friendly, and capable for basic analysis.

#### 💾 Save & Load Captures ✅ - 100 % Complete 

- Implement functionality to save captured packets to PCAP files  ✅
- Allow loading and analyzing existing PCAP files within SP3CTR's interface  ✅

#### 📚 Enhanced Packet Detail View ✅ - 100% Complete

- Provide a dedicated panel to show more detailed, human-readable information about a selected packet  ✅
- Include tooltips ❓ to explain common networking terms and abbreviations directly in the UI  ✅

#### 🎨 UI Polish & Refinements 100 % Complete

- Introduce more intuitive icons for protocols and actions ✅ 
- Refine the layout for better readability and information hierarchy ✅
- Glassmorphism "Aero" UI -  ✅

#### 🔍 Advanced Basic Filtering ✅ - 100 % Complete

- Expand pre-defined filters (e.g., "Show only HTTP/S traffic", "Show only DNS traffic")  ✅
- Implement a simple text input field for filtering by IP address, port number, or protocol name  ✅

---

### Phase 2: Introducing Basic Threat Recognition & "Spectral" Visuals (Est. v0.6 – v0.7)

This phase brings SP3CTR's unique value: visual context and meaningful alerts.

#### 🚨 Basic Threat Intelligence Integration ✅ - 100 % Complete

- Flag connections to/from known malicious IP addresses or domains using a curated, updatable local list  
- Clear visual indicators for such flagged packets/connections  

#### 🔓 Insecure Protocol Detection ✅ - 100 % Complete 

- Identify and highlight the use of insecure protocols (Telnet, FTP, cleartext HTTP auth, etc.)  ✅ 

#### 📡 Basic Port Scan Detection ✅ - 100 % Complete

- Implement simple heuristics to detect and alert on port scanning patterns  

#### 📊 Initial "Spectral" Display - ✅ - 100 % Complete

- Real-time chart (e.g., pie/bar) showing protocol distribution (TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)  

#### 💡 "Why it Matters" Explanations ✅ - 100 % Complete 

- For common packet types or alerts, include plain-language explanations of what they are and why they matter 

---

### Phase 3: Advanced UX & Deeper Analytical Insights (Est. v0.8 – v0.9)

Designed to help users develop intuitive, story-based understandings of their traffic.

#### 🌊 Simplified Traffic Flow Visualization (Alpha) 

- Show "Your Computer" talking to remote IPs via basic visual graph  
- Use lines/weights to indicate traffic type or volume  

#### 🗂️ Application-Level Categorization (Heuristic) ✅ - 80 % Complete

- Attempt heuristic grouping of traffic into categories: "Web Browsing", "DNS Lookup", "Online Gaming", etc.  

#### 📜 Basic "Storytelling" for Packet Sequences ✅ - 100 % Complete

- DNS query → TCP handshake → HTTP GET summarized as readable micro-narratives  

#### ⚙️ More Sophisticated Anomaly Flags (Simple) ✅ - 80 % Complete

- Flag odd behaviors: large DNS payloads, non-standard ports, etc.  
- Clearly mark as heuristic—not authoritative
