# 🧃 SP3CTR Dev Diary #1: JavaScript, You Vile Goblin

**Date:** [Insert today's date, because I'm too tired to remember what day it is]  
**Build Status:** Miraculously Functional™  
**Mood:** 60% caffeine, 40% resentment

## 🚩 Today’s Milestone: Core Functionality, Finally

After a day that felt like fighting a hydra with a toothpick, **SP3CTR** (yes, it’s pronounced “specter,” no, I will not argue) now has a working, functional, sane(ish) core. What began as a harmless to-do list on the `roadmap.md` turned into a twelve-hour endurance match with the JavaScript demon horde. And I won. Mostly.

## 🔨 What Actually Got Done

### 1. 🎬 Phase 1 Kickoff: The Beginning of the End

Started implementing the core features from Phase 1, with an absurd level of optimism. On the docket:
- Save/Load Capture: so your packets don’t vanish into the void
- Basic Filtering: so you can pretend you're narrowing things down
- Foundation for whatever form of stability passes for "good enough" these days

---

### 2. 🐍 Created `run_sp3ctr.py`, Because Batch Files Are a Joke

The original `.bat` launcher? Instantly betrayed me. So I built a Python launcher instead. Because if I'm going to suffer, I want to suffer in a language I can at least debug without a Ouija board.

- Spins up both backend (WebSocket) and frontend (HTTP) servers
- Opens the app in your default browser like a gentleman
- Leaves backend terminal open, because otherwise you’d never know what died

### 3. 🧟 JavaScript Whack-a-Mole: The Saga

I’d describe today’s frontend debugging experience as “trying to plug a dam with chewing gum while blindfolded.” Every time I fixed one thing, three others exploded. Here’s what fell apart and how I duct-taped it back together:

- **WebSocket wouldn’t connect**: Turns out it helps to write code that actually... connects
- **Interface dropdown refused to populate**: Because clearly JSON is just a suggestion now
- **Start/Stop buttons were allergic to clicks**: I taught them some manners
- **Packet display showed exactly zero packets**: Small oversight—forgot to tell the UI to *show* them

---

### 4. 🔁 Rebuild It From Ash, One Button at a Time

Eventually gave up trying to fix the giant tangled mess and started over like a sane person:

- Started with a skeleton script that just connected to the backend
- Re-added features one at a time:
  - Interface dropdown
  - Start button
  - Stop button
  - Packet display
  - Save & filter logic (aka the real pain)

Moral of the story: don’t be a hero. Rip it apart and build it back clean.

### 5. 🧱 Core Features: Online and Somehow Stable

Against all odds, SP3CTR now has a working feature set:

- ⏯️ **Start/Stop Packet Capture**: The bare minimum has arrived
- 💾 **Save to `.pcap`**: Because no one wants to lose their packets after rage quitting
- 🔍 **Client-side Filtering**: Finally lets you pretend you know what you’re looking for

It’s not perfect, but it’s functional, which is as close as any dev gets to happiness.

---

### 6. 📢 Philosophy, or Whatever You Call the Stuff That Keeps You From Screaming

Today I re-learned the value of **transparent operation**—because when your app breaks, and it will, you’ll want every damn error printed in full caps across your terminal and maybe your soul.

Verbose logging isn’t optional. It’s a way of life now.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts Before Collapsing

SP3CTR now walks on its own. Mostly in a straight line. Which is more than I can say for myself.  
The core's done. JavaScript is mostly sedated. My Python launcher has earned its keep. And I can see Phase 2 on the horizon, looming like a tax audit.

If you're reading this and you're me: good luck tomorrow.  
If you’re not me: why are you here, and do you want to buy some software?
