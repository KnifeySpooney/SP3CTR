# 🧃 Dev Diary #3.5: Into the Void (Phase 2 Beckons)

*"The transition from 90% to 100% feels less like crossing a finish line and more like stepping off a cliff into deeper waters."*

Phase 1 is dead. Long live Phase 1.  
--
It didn’t go quietly. The last 10% clawed like a raccoon in a storm drain — ugly, desperate, loud. Every patch opened two new wounds. Every solved bug uncovered an architectural regret I’ll now have to cohabitate with, like a roommate I can’t afford to evict. But it’s done. We slapped the commit seal on its forehead and shoved it out the airlock. It floats now in the great archival beyond, janky but alive — a functional ghost of the scaffolding that got us here

Phase 2 hangs overhead like a thunderhead with opinions. I can see the forks of lightning already, jagged outlines of complexity I’ve yet to give names to. It promises to be beautiful, terrible, and impossible to predict — which means it's right on schedule

## 🌑 The Great Darkening

Yes, there is now a dark mode. Sort of. Don’t get excited — it’s toggleable but half-formed. More chiaroscuro than theme. Some elements remain lit like a dentist's overhead, searing your rods and cones with the blinding spite of early CSS optimism. White mode? White mode is punitive. White mode feels like it *wants* you to fail your optometrist exam

We’ve traded `#fff` for shadows and regrets. The toggle is there. Like a treaty that nobody ratified, a whisper of UX dignity waiting to be enforced. Some buttons made the journey. Some are still out there, clinging to daylight like aging gods, immune to the passage of style sheets

But it’s a start. Future commits will bring coherence. Possibly sunglasses.

## 🧠 The Tippy Situation

So I added `Tippy.js`. Which sounds harmless, right? Tooltip library. Drag, drop, done.  
No. No, no. Tooltips are not small problems. Tooltips are the UI equivalent of urban planning. You don’t just *add* tooltips — you decide how they move, how they behave, what truth they owe the cursor. Suddenly you’re juggling pointer events, offset logic, tail geometry, and debating whether a tooltip should follow a mouse or stay stoic and still like a Roman statue

What emerged from the chaos, however, feels *intentional*. These aren't tooltips — they're pronouncements. They land softly, animate cleanly, and behave like they belong to software that bills monthly and has a customer support team. Which we don’t. Yet

## 🧩 Forward-Thinking Ghosts

Every component I touch now echoes with the sound of future scope creep. I’m writing props for use cases I can’t articulate yet. I’m nesting state in ways that *feel* scalable, even if they smell like YAGNI. It’s not code anymore — it’s prophecy. And prophecy, like software, is only as good as the assumptions you forgot to challenge

Navigation got rebuilt. Not out of necessity, but because Phase 1's route logic felt like putting a freight train on cobblestone. I saw the cracks before they formed. I saw the traffic coming. This isn’t UX polish — this is civil engineering

## 🌵 The 90-100% Desert

Nobody warns you that the final 10% is a desert. You think it’s debugging. It isn’t. It’s decision-making under duress. Every line becomes a choice between correct and complete, between clever and stable, between “ideal” and “what ships before I dissolve into a pile of burnt-out dev neurons”

I chose shipping. Imperfect, intentional, scarred code — but mine. And it works. Mostly.  
Each compromise stings like a paper cut made of principle. But they fade when the app opens and does its job without complaint

## 🐉 Phase 2: Here Be Dragons

Phase 2 isn’t a continuation. It’s a genre shift. Phase 1 was an experiment — Phase 2 is a thesis. The bones must calcify. The prototype must evolve. We’re crossing the line from “proof of concept” to “you might want to use this unironically”

The tasks changed their verbs. We’re no longer “adding” — we’re “refactoring,” “hardening,” “scaling.” These aren’t bugs anymore. They’re systems problems. Architecture problems. The kind of problems that make your folder structure feel like it's watching you make decisions it doesn’t agree with

I can feel the shape of it — the software that wants to emerge, humming under the UI like a presence. Every feature I write now feels like translation. There is a better version of this app that exists beyond the hill, and I’m just laying stones to get us closer

Dark mode will stabilize. Tooltips will behave. The architecture will either hold — or collapse spectacularly and be rewritten in a weekend of panic and coffee

We are building something.  
I can feel it in the GERD.
